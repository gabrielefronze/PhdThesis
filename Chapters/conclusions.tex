\chapter{Conclusions}

The present work allowed for a deep understanding of all the systems and methodologies involved in the study of quarkonium production with ALICE at the LHC.

In order to ensure the correct behaviour of the ALICE muon trigger system, a detailed study of the MTR performances has been performed.
From such measurements the good shape of the muon trigger system has been verified, with the exception of some outliers which by the way are not yet affected by performances issues.
The measurements that have been performed allowed for a verification of the expected performances of the new electronics, FEERIC, whose installation is planned for the next long shutdown of the LHC.

The study of the performances of the MTR lead to the development of a framework able to combine several sources of data regarding the detector functionality and the LHC status.
Such tool, called \code{MTRShuttle} might be extended to other systems in the future and constitutes a valuable help for the study of the variations and distributions of the main working parameters of the systems installed in the ALICE apparatus.


After ensuring the expected performances of the MTR were satisfied during the data taking period, the study of the Upsilon production at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{S_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02TeV$ has been performed.

The measured abundance of $\Upsilon(1S)$ and $(2S)$ allowed for the computation of double ratios which values are aligned with the hypothesis of a binding-energy dependent sequential suppression in the QGP.
In addition the ratios computed at several colliding energies didn't show an energy hierarchy.
From the comparison of $J/\psi$ measured at RHIC and $\Upsilon(1S)$ obtained at the LHC a symmetry can be noticed.

This observation corroborates the hypotesis that the production cross section mainly and strongly depends on the average number of produced $c-\bar{c}$ and $b-\bar{b}$ pairs, since the number of charm and bottom quarks pairs is expected to be equivalent at RHIC and at the LHC respectively.

The comparison of the experimental results with theoretical models didn't allow for a clear conclusion on the presence of recombination mechanisms for bottomonia.
The theoretical uncertainty bands and the statistical uncertainties on the measurements both have to be further reduced in order to get to a conclusive result.


In order to satisfy such requirement the ALICE collaboration is pursuing a complex hardware and software upgrade program called $O^2$.
With this upgrade the data rate will pass from $1kHz$ to $50 kHz$ of minimum bias events.
Thanks to online processing of all the $50 kHz$ of events, the limit bandwidth of $8kHz$ will be filled only of interesting events, discarding online the trivial ones.

The ALICE MTR will undergo a big upgrade process, involving the read out electronics and the whole software and hardware apparatus.
In order to comply with the interaction rate expected in 2020 ($50 kHz$) the MTR will become a MID (Muon Identifier) losing its triggering purposes.
Such evolution requires a change of paradigm necessary to use the detector as a complete tracking system.
In the context of this work a big effort has been put to develop a fast, precise and resilient software capable of coping with the run specifications.
As a result the ALICE MTR/MID will be able to retain most of its features and performances along with an highly improved rate capability.

The development of the upgrade path is not yet completely developed, but the boost given by this work is an important fraction of the planned tasks.


Thanks to this work a better and deeper knowledge of the RPCs of the MTR/MID has been achieved, highlighting behaviour patterns and interesting correlations between working parameters.
This task was of crucial importance for the study of Bottomonium production in order to correctly understand the detectors performances, hence to spot and quote all the possible sources of systematic uncertainty.

The results of the Bottomonium study highlighted the need for more data to improve the results and obtain decisive measurements to better understand the QGP dynamics.

Taking part to the MTR/MID $O^2$ upgrade program was critical to put the right basis for the performance update which will help tackling the nowadays statistical limits in Bottomonium studies with ALICE.
